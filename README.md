# 03 UX and Advanced CSS: Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description 

This project is to build a portfolio layout using the Bootstrap (v4) CSS Framework from scratch.  
 
A portfolio of work can showcase the web development skills and talents to potential employers. An effective portfolio highlights our strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. A portfolio with deployed web applications is very helpful for our career search. 

Because I don't have any deployed working web applications to showcase at this point, I have used the images of several award-winning websites as placeholder for my future applications. I can change them to real applications as I create them later in the course.

This project needs to meet the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs as shown below:

* A navigation menu at the top. Include links that are applicable to the portfolio. Links should navigate to the appropriate sections
* A hero section: A jumbotron featuring a picture, my name, and any other information I'd like to include
* A work section: A section displaying work in grid. Use Bootstrap cards for each project. Award-winning websites are used as placeholders, with a brief overview of the work. Each project will eventually link to my class project work
* A skills section: List out the skills expected to learn from the bootcamp
* A contact section: a section in the same row
* A footer section: All hyperlinks should have a hover effect. All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover

## Installation
The link to my portfolio page:
https://dr-jingyuezhao.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/

## Usage 

* On the top of the page, it presents my name, and navigations to each section on the page.  
* Click one of the links in the navigation, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section: "About Me", "Work", "Skills", "Contact Me"
* The "About Me" section is a short summary of my professional achievements 
* The "Work" section contains titled images of some web applications
* The "Skills" section lists out the skills expected to learn from the bootcamp
* The "Contact Me" section contains the information about how to contact me in different ways
